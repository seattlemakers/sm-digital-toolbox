# sm-digital-toolbox

Small web tools for Seattle Makers, all on one static site.

| Tool | Path | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Today | `/today` | What is on in the space today, refreshing itself. Built for a screen by the door. |
| Studio calendar | `/calendar` | A month of one studio's sessions on a branded landscape sheet, to print and pin to that studio's door. |
| Slideshow | `/slideshow` | A looping reel of studio photos and upcoming classes, for running full-screen at markets and tabling events. **Parked** - still serves, but off the index. |
| Labels | `/labels` | Designs one label — title, subtitle, optional QR — and prints it onto the Label Station's sheets, skipping positions already peeled. |

Owned by Seattle Makers. If you are moving this repo or its deployment between
accounts, read [HANDOVER.md](HANDOVER.md) first - the deployment is
account-bound in ways the code is not.

Astro + Tailwind v4, static output. Every asset is local — once the page has
loaded, the reel keeps running with the network unplugged.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Dev server at http://localhost:4321 |
| `npm run build` | Static site into `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the built `dist/` |
| `npm run events` | Refresh event data from seattlemakers.org |
| `npm run qr` | Regenerate the QR codes in `public/brand/` |

## The today board

`/today` lists everything on the calendar for the current day - classes,
certifications, meetups, open studio hours, tours and orientations - with the
time, what kind of thing it is, and whether it is full, nearly full or
cancelled. It is meant for a screen by the door, so it refreshes itself: every
five minutes, and again whenever the screen is woken.

**It shows more than the reel does.** The slideshow hides tours, open studio
hours and orientations, because those are operational scheduling rather than
something to advertise to a stranger at a market. Inside the space that is
exactly backwards - they are most of what someone in the doorway wants to know,
and on a typical day they are most of what is on. Filtering them would have
left today's board empty.

**The page is correct before any JavaScript runs.** Astro renders the day from
the baked calendar at build time, and the script only replaces it when a fetch
actually succeeds. Every failure path leaves what is on screen alone: a board
showing an older day beats a board showing an error, and a venue with no
network still gets a board.

**It is live on the deployed site, and it says which it is.** The board reads
`/api/events`, a Cloudflare Worker that scrapes the calendar on demand
and returns JSON. Every reload gets the real calendar - no cron, no commits, no
rebuild.

**The function exists because a browser cannot do this itself.** Fetching
seattlemakers.org from the page is blocked outright: that page sends no
`access-control-allow-origin`, so the request fails before any of our code sees
a byte, and there is no API behind it either. Server-to-server requests are not
subject to that rule, so the function does the fetch and hands the result back
from our own origin, which the page *is* allowed to read. No amount of
JavaScript in the page can substitute for it.

**For the one day being shown, it also opens each event's own page**, which is
where the description and the picture live - the calendar grid carries neither.
That is three to six extra requests behind one board refresh, capped so a
malformed `day` cannot fan out further. About half the calendar's events have a
usable picture; the rest are studio badges, icon sheets and pages with no image
at all, and [`src/lib/event-image.mjs`](src/lib/event-image.mjs) sorts them by
size and compression density. A row with no usable picture falls back to its
studio's icon on a tinted tile, and a row belonging to no studio - a tour, an
orientation, game night - shows nothing.

It runs the same parser as the scraper - [`src/lib/parse-calendar.mjs`](src/lib/parse-calendar.mjs),
which is pure string-handling with no filesystem access precisely so it can run
in both places. One parser, so a calendar redesign cannot break one while the
other keeps working.

**Where there is no function, it degrades instead of breaking.** During `astro
dev`, or on a host without functions, `/api/events` 404s and the board falls
back to nothing - there is no second source. It then labels
itself honestly: `live · checked 3:10 pm` when it really did just scrape, and
`calendar 27 aug · checked 3:10 pm` when it is serving build-time data. Those
are two different facts and the footer never conflates them.

If the scrape fails upstream - the site is down, or its markup moved - the
function reports the failure rather than serving something older. The board
then says **"Cannot reach the calendar right now."** It used to fall back to a
calendar baked in at build time, but that file only refreshed when somebody ran
`npm run events`, and nobody did, so the safety net was a schedule from weeks
earlier. A board that admits it cannot see is worth more than one confidently
showing the wrong day.

`npm run events` still exists. It now refreshes two things that are *not* the
board's schedule: the reel's offline calendar, and the event descriptions the
API grafts onto live rows (about half of them match by title).

### Running it locally with the live API

`npm run dev` now serves `/api/events` itself, using the same module the Worker
does, so the board works normally while you edit - including picking other
dates in the debug panel.

`npm run preview` does not: it is a different server and still serves static
files only, so `/api/events` 404s there and the board falls back to the
nothing at all - which means **the board shows "Cannot reach the calendar right
now." under `npm run preview`.** That is correct behaviour, not a bug: there is
no source there.

To exercise the real thing:

```
npm run serve
```

That builds and runs the Worker (fetching wrangler on first use). `/api/events`
then scrapes the calendar per request, and the stamp reads "Last updated 9:41
pm" - the live wording. Worth doing before believing anything about freshness.

### Testing with a dummy calendar

`/today?src=/events-dummy.json` points the board at a fake busy day, which is
the only practical way to see every state at once - the real calendar usually
has one or two things on. The fixture carries a cancelled class, a sold-out
one, two nearly-full ones, a multi-part series and a meetup.

Its times are generated **at build time, relative to the build's clock**, so
there is always something running and (before about 9pm) something up next.
Rebuild and it moves with you.

### Seeing the board at another time

Every state on the board - on now, up next, finished - depends on the clock, so
most of them are unreachable when you happen to be looking. Two query
parameters, both client-side only:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `?debug=1` | a panel at the bottom with a date picker, a time slider, a count of each state, and **Back to live** |
| `?now=HH:MM` | sets the clock straight from the URL, optionally with `?on=YYYY-MM-DD` |

`/today?src=/events-dummy.json&debug=1` is the one to reach for. Drag the
slider and watch rows move from later, to up next, to on now, to finished.

**A red bar across the top means the clock is simulated.** It appears whenever
either parameter is in play, with or without the panel - a board on a wall
showing a made-up time with nothing saying so would be worse than a stale one.

### Running it on a vertical screen

`/today` fills a portrait display with nothing to scroll. It switches to that
layout on its own for portrait viewports at least 700x1200 - above a tablet in
portrait, so a phone never turns into a wall board - and `?tv=1` forces it for
checking the layout on a laptop. `?tv=0` forces it off.

If the day has more events than fit, the board drops finished ones first, then
the far end of the day, and says how many it left off. It will not drop what is
on now or what is next.

`src=` only accepts same-origin paths. An absolute or protocol-relative URL
falls back to the real calendar - otherwise a shared link would be a way to put
arbitrary text on a screen in the space.

## Running the reel at a market

Build it, serve `dist/`, and open Chrome in kiosk mode:

```bash
npm run build && npm run preview
```

```bash
open -na "Google Chrome" --args --kiosk --app=http://localhost:4321/slideshow
```

`Esc` leaves kiosk mode. The page requests a **screen wake lock**, so the
display should not sleep while the reel is running — but check the machine's own
power settings too, since a wake lock cannot stop a system-level sleep.

### While it runs

Move the mouse and a **control bar** fades in at the bottom-right: previous,
pause/play, next, a dwell progress bar, the slide counter, speed down/up, the
QR code, and full screen. It hides again after a couple of idle seconds, along
with the cursor, so an unattended machine shows nothing but the reel.

The same actions have keys:

| Key | |
| --- | --- |
| `space` | pause / resume |
| `←` `→` | previous / next slide |
| `q` | show / hide the interest-form QR |
| `f` | toggle full screen |
| `esc` | close the QR |

Resuming from pause restarts the slide's full dwell rather than finishing a
part-spent one, so the slide you unpaused on gets a proper look.

### The interest-form QR

Press `q` (or hit the QR button) and a full-screen card goes up with a large
code for **seattlemakers.org/interest** — the interest form and liability
waiver — for holding out to someone who wants to sign up on the spot. Clicking
anywhere or pressing `esc` dismisses it.

Opening it pauses the reel so the slide behind does not change mid-scan, and
closing resumes only if the reel was running beforehand. The same code also sits
on the brand card, where the deck used to have a map.

The codes are **generated at author time** into `public/brand/*.svg` by
`npm run qr`, so the page carries no QR library and makes no network call. To
point one somewhere else, edit the `CODES` list in
[`scripts/make-qr.mjs`](scripts/make-qr.mjs) and re-run it. They use the highest
error-correction level, since these get scanned off a screen at an angle in
daylight.

### URL options

| Param | Default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `seconds` | `9` | Seconds per slide |
| `fade` | `900` | Crossfade in ms |
| `studios` | all | Comma-separated slugs, e.g. `?studios=woodshop,ceramics` |
| `events` | `1` | `?events=0` for photos only |

## Adding a studio's photos

Photos are discovered from the filesystem, so this is mostly drag-and-drop:

1. Put landscape JPEGs (1920px wide or better) in `public/studios/<slug>/`.
   They appear in filename order; `01.jpg`, `02.jpg`, `03.jpg` is the convention.
2. If the studio is new, point its `icon` at a file in `public/brand/icons/`.
   The field is a path, not a convention - several studios reference a file
   named for the brand sheet rather than for their own slug
   and a line to `STUDIOS` in [`src/data/studios.ts`](src/data/studios.ts).

The reel picks the change up on the next build. Two photos per studio are used
per loop — the deck used three, but that was across six studios; at twelve it
makes the loop long enough that a passer-by waits too long for the events to
come round again. Extra photos in a folder are harmless; `PHOTOS_PER_STUDIO` in
[`src/lib/reel.ts`](src/lib/reel.ts) sets how many are used.

`studios.ts` is also where calendar categories are mapped onto studios — that
mapping is many-to-one on purpose (`cnc` and `cnc-routing` are one studio;
`cosplay`, `design` and `crafts` are topical tags and map to nothing) — and
where `preferEvent` lets you name the class a studio should feature.

## Refreshing events

```bash
npm run events
```

Run it before a market. It rewrites `src/data/events.json`, so rebuild after.

### How event data works

There is no usable API. The WordPress REST API and `/wp-json/` both return 401,
`?ical=1` returns HTML, and `/events/feed/` carries only post-publish dates
rather than event dates. So `scripts/fetch-events.mjs` scrapes the calendar page
— one unauthenticated GET returns about a year of events — and then pulls each
distinct class's blurb from its own page's `og:description`.

Because it is a scrape, it is the part most likely to break if the site is
redesigned. It fails loudly rather than silently: if it parses zero events it
exits non-zero and leaves the previous `events.json` alone.

It also saves each event's own picture into `public/events/`, so an event card
shows the actual class rather than a generic studio shot. Two filters decide
what is worth keeping:

- **under 600px wide** — the site has a batch of 300px category tiles that would
  be upscaled past the point of looking deliberate.
- **under 0.06 compressed bytes per pixel** — size alone does not separate the
  site's logo tiles from real photos, since both arrive at 1220px. Compression
  does: flat artwork squeezes to a fraction of what a photograph needs. On the
  current calendar the logo tiles sit at 0.018–0.054 and every real photo at
  0.080 or above.

Anything rejected falls back to a studio photo. Promotional artwork (a game
night poster, a sew-along flyer) scores like a photo and is kept, which is the
intent — it is real art for that event. If a logo ever slips through, delete it
from `public/events/` and that card falls back too.

Both `src/data/events.json` and `public/events/` are generated but **committed**,
so a fresh clone builds a working reel without touching the network.

**Prices are deliberately absent.** They are not published anywhere
machine-readable — they live behind the cart — and a stale price on a public
display is worse than no price.

### Which events reach a slide

One card per studio, and it sits **directly after that studio's photos** — the
class on offer is for the room you were just looking at.

The pick prefers a **class** over a **certification** over a **meetup**, looking
120 days ahead, so a real class next month beats a certification next week.
Certifications only surface for studios that genuinely have no class scheduled.
Open studio hours, tours and orientations never appear, and neither do sold-out
or cancelled classes — so a studio whose classes are all full has no card that
week. (Organisers mark a scrapped class by editing "(CANCELLED)" into its title
rather than removing the event, so that string is the only signal there is.)

When the ranking is defensible but a different class would sell the studio
better, set `preferEvent` on that studio in `studios.ts` to a substring of the
title. It wins outright whenever it is upcoming, and quietly stops applying once
it is not, so a stale override can never empty a card:

```ts
{ slug: 'electronics', …, preferEvent: 'Programmable LEDs' }
```

The card shows the **event's own photo** when its page had one worth using, and
the **studio icon** on a tinted panel otherwise — never a generic studio photo,
which in that frame would read as a picture of the class itself.

Each card also carries its next few occurrences in the markup, and the browser
reveals the first one still in the future. That way a build from a fortnight ago
still shows a real date instead of advertising a class that already ran.

## Printing a studio's month

`/calendar` makes the sheet that goes on a studio door: one month of that
studio's sessions, on the brand's green, with a QR to the booking page.

Pick a studio, step to the month you want, and print. The defaults are the
common case - portrait, open studio hours included, QR on - so most of the time
it is two clicks.

**Nothing is drawn until a studio is chosen.** The page opens on instructions
rather than on a sheet, because the one thing the tool cannot guess is whose
door this is for. The month, paper and note controls stay live meanwhile - they
are settings for the sheet you are about to make, not properties of one that
already exists.

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Studio | One studio, or **Everything at Seattle Makers** for a front-door sheet. Nothing is selected to begin with. |
| Month | Steps a month at a time. The calendar runs about a year ahead. |
| Open studio hours | The recurring guided-studio sessions, tours and orientations. On by default — on a studio door they are usually the most useful rows on the sheet. |
| QR code | Points at seattlemakers.org/events. |
| Note at the foot | One optional line, e.g. "Ask a steward if you need a hand". |

**Everything is in the query string**, so a studio can bookmark its own sheet and
come back to it on the first of every month:

```
/calendar?studio=woodshop&month=2026-10&open=0&qr=0&note=Ask+a+steward
```

`studio` is the slug, or `all` for the whole space. With it absent nothing is
selected and the rest of the query string is dropped, so a link either names
what it prints or prints nothing - there is no URL that quietly picks for you.

**The sheet is landscape, and that is not a setting.** Both were offered at
first; landscape simply renders better, for a reason that is arithmetic rather
than taste. A cell is 1.46in wide landscape against 1.1in portrait, which at
7pt is about 28 characters a line against 20 - and the calendar's median title
is 27 characters. So titles that wrapped onto two lines in every cell now sit
on one. Keeping portrait as an option was keeping a way to make a worse sign.

**The QR goes to that studio's own events**, at
`seattlemakers.org/events/types/<slug>/` - a real taxonomy archive on the site.
The address is printed at the foot of the sheet as well, and it is always the
same string the code encodes.

Two studios are the exception. metalworking and the a/v studio carry no
calendar tag at all, so there is no archive to link and their sheets fall back
to the whole calendar. That is not a special case in the code: the slug comes
from the studio's own `eventCategories`, so a studio with no tag has no slug.
It matters because the archive **soft-404s** - an unknown term returns HTTP 200
with an empty page rather than a 404, so a wrong link would look fine right up
until someone scanned it.

cnc is the other wrinkle: its events are split across `cnc` (3) and
`cnc-routing` (5, a superset), and passing both silently resolves to the first.
It is pinned to `cnc-routing` in `ARCHIVE_SLUG`. Both are
[WISHLIST.md](WISHLIST.md) item 2 - one reliable tag per studio.

**What the sheet deliberately does not say.** Cancelled classes are left off
entirely - a sign printed three weeks ago advertising a class that is not
happening is worse than one that never mentioned it. Sold-out ones stay, without
saying so: availability printed on a door in week one is a lie by week three,
which is what the QR is there to answer. Emoji are stripped from titles, because
a cell is about an inch wide and the sheet already carries the studio's icon
twenty times larger.

**A day with more sessions than fit says so.** Each cell is measured after
layout and shows "+3 more" rather than quietly clipping - which only ever
happens on the whole-space sheet, since the busiest single studio-day on the
calendar has two sessions on it.

**A studio with nothing that month prints a sheet saying so**, rather than an
empty grid. An empty grid reads as a tool that failed, and somebody then has to
decide whether to pin it up.

Two studios - metalworking and the a/v studio - carry no calendar tag that maps
to them, so they can never match an event. The dropdown says so next to their
names rather than showing them as quiet blanks. That is
[WISHLIST.md](WISHLIST.md) item 2, not a bug here.

## Printing labels

`/labels` prints onto the Label Station's stock. Pick a sheet, type a title and
subtitle, optionally add a link for a QR, then click any position on the sheet
preview to switch it off — leave out labels that have already been peeled.

| Stock | Label | Per sheet | Sheet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 × 5in | 8 × 5in / 5 × 8in | 2 | portrait / landscape |
| 4 × 2.5in | 4 × 2.5in / 2.5 × 4in | 8 | portrait / landscape |
| 4 × 1in | 4 × 1in | 20 | portrait |
| 2.5 × 1.56in | 2.5 × 1.56in / 1.56 × 2.5in | 18 | portrait / landscape |

**"Across" and "Upright" are the same physical sheet**, and both print portrait.
They put ink on exactly the same die-cut rectangles — Upright just turns the
words a quarter turn inside each label. So a sheet is never wasted by picking
the wrong one, the preview always matches the sheet in your hand, and every job
feeds the same way.

**One label is printed by default.** Positions are numbered on the preview:
green with a solid edge means it prints, grey and ghosted means it does not.
Click to switch a position on or off, or use All / Clear.

**Load the sheet face down, with the top edge towards you** (the Brother
printers in the space). **Then check the print dialog every time** — no headers
or footers, margins off, scale at 100%. Browsers reset these between sessions
and sometimes between jobs. These pages are full-bleed by necessity — the
die-cut is where it is, so the page cannot carry a safety margin, and anything
other than true size puts the ink between the labels.

The **subtitle** is a small rich-text editor — bold, italics, inline code, bullet
and numbered lists. The title is plain text by design.

Alignment defaults to **Auto**: centered, except when a code sits beside the words
on a wide label, where everything goes left so the label reads as one object.
Override it with Left or Center — a checklist usually wants Left whatever the
code is doing. Type also starts a notch smaller when there is a code to share the
room with. Type sizes itself to the label and shrinks to fit, so a long title stays on
the label instead of breaking mid-word, and the title-to-copy ratio stays the
same (1.8×) on every stock. Two things to watch:

- **A QR on the 4 × 1in or 2.5 × 1.56in stock is tight.** Those labels cannot
  hold a code much over 0.6mm per module with a normal URL, and the tool warns
  below 0.8mm. Use a short link, or a bigger label.
- **Nothing is saved.** To keep a sheet, bookmark it —
  `?stock=&dir=&align=&title=&sub=&url=&on=` fills the form. `on=` names the
  positions to print (1-based, matching the numbers on the preview), and `sub=`
  may carry markup, so a bookmarked checklist keeps its bullets.

## Deploying

The site is static and builds to `dist/`. The one piece of server code is
[`worker/index.js`](worker/index.js), which Cloudflare
serves alongside it - that is what makes the today board live.

```bash
npx wrangler pages deploy
```

**Prefer the git integration over deploying from a laptop.** Connect the
Cloudflare Worker to this GitHub repo and every push to `main` builds
and deploys itself. Then GitHub access is the only access a contributor ever
needs: no `wrangler` install, no Cloudflare credentials, no knowing which host
it is on. Laptop deploys ship whatever happens to be on that person's disk and
need per-person credentials, which is the wrong shape for a shared project.

Any host that runs server code works - Vercel, Netlify and Deno Deploy all do.
GitHub Pages does not: it is static-only, so `/api/events` would 404 and the
board would silently fall back to build-time data. It would still work, but it
would stop being live.

## Handover

Everything here is designed so that owning the repo is the same as owning the
tools. **It has changed hands:** the Worker was always on the makerspace's
Cloudflare account, and the repo moved to the `seattlemakers` GitHub org on
2026-09-20. [HANDOVER.md](HANDOVER.md) is the authority on what that took and
what is still outstanding; this section is the shape of the thing.

**There is nothing to migrate but the repo.** The function reads no secrets,
has no environment variables, no bindings, no database and nothing stored in a
dashboard - it is a file in this repository. Whoever can merge to `main` can
change what the board does. There is no hidden state anywhere.

**Two things are tied to accounts rather than to the code:**

| Thing | Who holds it | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The Cloudflare Worker | Whoever created it | Workers cannot be moved between accounts - you delete and recreate, which changes the `*.workers.dev` URL |
| The domain | Whoever runs DNS | A subdomain of seattlemakers.org makes the host swappable underneath |

So **create the Cloudflare account under an organisation identity**, not a
personal one - a role address like `tech@seattlemakers.org` rather than a
member's own login. Cloudflare supports inviting further members with roles,
though with the git integration most contributors never need an account at all.

**Recreating the deployment from scratch**, if it is ever lost, is:

1. Create a Cloudflare Worker, connect it to this repo
2. Build command `npm run build`, output directory `dist`
3. Point the subdomain at it

There is no step four. No secrets to re-enter, no data to restore.

**`npm run events` currently writes a file nothing reads.** `src/data/events.json`
was deleted; the board reads the live API instead. Re-running the script
restores the file and, with it, the reel's event slides - see *Next* in
CLAUDE.md for why that is not the intended fix. It rewrites
`src/data/events.json` and the pictures in `public/events/`. It is manual, and
it does not affect whether the board is live - the board reads the API and has
no fallback to refresh. Commit the result.

**The fragile part is the scrape**, and it is fragile on purpose rather than by
accident: there is no API, so both the script and the function parse the
calendar's HTML. If the site is redesigned, the parser breaks. It fails loudly
- the script exits non-zero and leaves the previous data in place, and the
function treats a zero-event parse as a failure and reports it -
so the failure mode is stale data, never an empty board. Fixing it means
updating [`src/lib/parse-calendar.mjs`](src/lib/parse-calendar.mjs), which both
callers share.

## Provenance of the artwork

**Studio photos** come from the shared *Social Media Photos* Google Photos
album, named `NN-album-NNN.jpg`. They show the current Interbay space.

**Photos named `50-deck-NN.jpg`** were extracted from the *Background Reel* PDF.
They are of the **old Wallingford space**, so they sort behind the album photos
and only appear if a studio runs out. Delete them once every studio has enough
current photos.

The wordmark and eight studio icons also came out of that PDF at full
resolution; four icons (ceramics, screen printing, leatherworking, classroom)
are drawn to match, as the deck predates those studios.

The deck's brand card is not reused: it lists eight services and the old
Wallingford address with a Gas Works Park map. `BrandSlide.astro` rebuilds it
with the twelve current studios and the Interbay location.

### Pulling more from the album

The share page embeds its photo list as JSON in an `AF_initDataCallback` block
keyed `ds:1`; each record is `[id, [url, width, height], takenMs, …]` and a
full-size download is that url plus `=w2400`.

Two things to watch:

- **Videos.** Their thumbnails come back with a play button burned in, which
  looks like a bug on a slide. A record is a video when its trailing dict has
  the key `76647426` — 26 of the album's 300 items are.
- **Only the first ~300 records are embedded**, newest first, reaching back to
  2025-07-18; the album itself goes back to 2022. Older ones need the
  continuation token in `data[2]`.

**Still missing photos: leatherworking and a/v studio.** Neither appears in the
album's recent pages. They have icons and will show event cards, but no photo
block until someone adds files to `public/studios/`.
