/**
 * Live refresh, live clock, and the fit, for /today.
 *
 * The page is already correct when this loads - Astro rendered today's events
 * at build time. Three things happen on top of that, and they are separate on
 * purpose:
 *
 *   refresh()  every 5 minutes, and on visibilitychange. Replaces *what* is on.
 *              Every failure path is a no-op: a screen in the space showing
 *              yesterday's board beats one showing an error.
 *   tick()     every 30 seconds, no network. Re-stamps *where the day stands* -
 *              past / live / next / later - so the board walks through the day
 *              on its own. This is what makes it a live view rather than a list
 *              that happens to reload.
 *   fit()      after either, in display mode only. Hides whatever will not fit
 *              the viewport, because a wall screen cannot be scrolled.
 *
 * Only the *type* comes from lib/events - importing the module would pull
 * events.json, 72K, into this bundle, which is exactly what the fetch exists to
 * avoid. The status rules live in lib/day-status, which imports no data, so
 * this file and today.astro share one implementation instead of keeping two
 * copies of the same rules in step by hand.
 *
 * data/studios is safe to import here for the same reason: it is a list and a
 * lookup table with no data import behind it, so the studio map costs about a
 * kilobyte rather than the whole calendar.
