 * year in a single GET, so stepping from September to December costs nothing
 * once the page has loaded.
 *
 * `?day=` is deliberately not passed. It makes the endpoint fetch each of that
 * day's event pages for a description and a thumbnail, and a month of those
 * would be thirty-odd subrequests for text this poster has no room to print.
 *
 * Only the *type* comes from lib/events - importing the module would drag its
 * data export into this bundle. data/studios is safe to import for real: it is
 * a list and a lookup table with no data behind it.

 * ceramics 18, sewing 27, print-making 20, woodworking 9, and so on - the same
 * numbers those categories have in the full calendar.
 *
 * **It soft-404s, which is the thing to be careful about.** An unknown term -
 * `/events/types/nonsense-slug/` - returns HTTP 200 with a 176,553-byte page
 * titled just "Seattle Makers" and no events on it at all. So does
 * `metalworking` and so does `av-studio`, because neither has a tag on the
 * calendar (WISHLIST item 2). A 200 is not evidence the link works.
 *
 * That trap is avoided by construction rather than by sniffing the response:
 * the slug comes from the studio's own `eventCategories`, so a studio with no
 * tag has no slug and falls back to the whole calendar. The two studios that
 * would soft-404 are exactly the two with an empty `eventCategories`.
