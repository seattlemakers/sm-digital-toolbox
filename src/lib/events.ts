 * "upcoming class" slide is gone, because `pickByStudio` has nothing to pick
 * from. That is a real loss to the market display and it is written up under
 * *Next* in CLAUDE.md. The reel cannot simply call /api/events instead: it is
 * built to keep running at a market with no wifi, which is why its data was
 * baked in the first place.
