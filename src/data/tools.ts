/**
 * What the tools are called and what they do - defined once.
 *
 * Each of these strings used to exist three times: on the index card, in the
 * page's own subtitle, and in its `<meta name="description">`. They had drifted
 * into three different answers per tool - the label maker's card said "Create
 * custom labels and QR codes to print on sticker paper", its page said "One
 * design, printed onto the sheet you choose", and search engines were told
 * "Design a label and print it onto the Label Station's sheets". All three were
 * true and none of them matched.
 *
 * Nothing enforced that they agree, so they did not. Now the card, the page and
 * the meta tag all read the same constant, and parity is a property of the code
 * rather than something to remember during a rename.
